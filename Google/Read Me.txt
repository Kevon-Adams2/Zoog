Mark,

There is a slack channel for GCP prep 
https://baton-rouge-cic.slack.com/archives/CJLLDR4PQ


Has a bunch of resources, including a pdf for Associate Cloud Engineer 
official study guide, too large to attach.

 
Cloud Digital Leader was high level, I went through the Udemy playlist  
Your Learning (ibm.com) and took sample questions by Google Cloud Digital Leader Sample
Questions (google.com)

 

Best,
