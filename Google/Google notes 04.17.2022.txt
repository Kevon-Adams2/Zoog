Cloud Profiler is a continuous profiling tool that is designed for applications running on Google Cloud:
    It's a statistical, or sampling, profiler that has low overhead 
    and is suitable for production environments.
Profiling is a form of dynamic code analysis. 
You capture characteristics of the application as it runs, 
and then you use this information to identify how to make your application faster 
and more efficient.
Historically, profiling was performed only during application development. 
This approach relied on the ability to develop load tests and benchmarks 
that could accurately predict a production environment.
Continuous profiling refers to profiling the application while it executes 
in a production environment. This approach alleviates the need to develop 
accurate predictive load tests and benchmarks for the production environment. 
Research on continuous profiling has shown it is accurate and cost effective*.
